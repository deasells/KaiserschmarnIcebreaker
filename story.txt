I was at the Flughafen.
I saw Gauss driving his BMW on the Hauptstrasse.
He was listening to some Musik and turned up the Klimaanlage. 
He decided to stop by the Baeckerei.
He purchased a Gebaeck, but as soon as he walked outside it was stolen by a Hund, crushing his spirit.
He just went back and got a Brot instead.
He spilt crumbs all over his lederhosen.
He heard a laugh from accross the room, it was Mehlhase. "I never spill anything on my Dirndel!" she exclaimed.
He laughed with her and together they chatted with Rammstein playing in the background.
They decided to visit a Biergarten and had a great time.
On their way to visit the Biergarten, Mehlhase said, "You looked more like a Porsche owner!".
